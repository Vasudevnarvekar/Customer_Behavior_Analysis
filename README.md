# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
Data Analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using python, SQL, and power BI.


# Data Analytics Project: Customer Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow**, starting from loading raw data in Python to building an interactive dashboard in Power BI. The objective is to analyze customer behavior, identify key patterns, and present actionable insights using industry-standard tools.

The project covers:

* Data loading and preprocessing in Python
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data cleaning and transformation
* SQL-based analysis using PostgreSQL / MySQL
* Data visualization and dashboarding in Power BI

---

## Dataset

* **Type:** Customer shopping / behavior dataset
* **Format:** CSV
* **Contents include:**

  * Customer demographics
  * Purchase frequency
  * Spending patterns
  * Product categories
  * Time-based attributes

The dataset is used to simulate a real-world business analytics scenario.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **SQL** (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
* **SQLAlchemy**
* **Power BI**
* **Git & GitHub**

---

## Project Workflow / Steps

### 1. Data Loading

* Loaded CSV dataset into Python using Pandas
* Verified structure, data types, and missing values

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Summary statistics
* Distribution analysis
* Outlier detection
* Correlation analysis
* Trend identification

### 3. Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Handled missing values
* Standardized categorical values
* Created derived columns (e.g., purchase frequency in days)
* Removed inconsistencies for analysis readiness

### 4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL / MySQL)

* Connected Python to database using SQLAlchemy
* Stored cleaned data in SQL tables
* Executed analytical SQL queries such as:

  * Customer segmentation
  * Purchase frequency analysis
  * Revenue trends
  * Category-wise performance

### 5. Power BI Dashboard

* Connected Power BI to SQL database
* Built interactive dashboards including :

  * Key KPIs
  * Customer segmentation
  * Purchase trends
  * Category performance
* Designed with a business-user focus

---

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides :

* Clear KPIs for decision-making
* Interactive filtering and slicing
* Visual insights into customer behavior and trends

*(Screenshots or `.pbix` file can be added here if available)*

---

## Results & Insights

* Identified high-value customer segments
* Observed purchase frequency and spending patterns
* Highlighted top-performing product categories
* Enabled data-driven insights through visualization
